6732,,User Story,Active,Matt Stephenson,Betteravia: Parent db user story,,,,"Acceptance Criteria:

1) Transplant GDD value is added to the accum GDD to get the YTD GDD
           - this is any GDD days that were gained prior to planting e.g., it was in a greenhouse prior to planting

2) Window (+ / -)
      - is the difference between the highest GDD and the Lowest GDD once the max and min are discarded

3) Days Early / Late
         - Current Projected Harvest date - Planned Harvest date

4) Discard the highest and the lowest GDD years for the field
         e.g., if there are 10 years of data for a field
                 count the gdd for each year
                 highest GDD year (warmest) is discarded
                 lowest GDD year (coldest) is discarded
                 the remaining 8 years (in the middle) are averaged together to get the harvest date

5) Determine the Predicted Harvest Date

----- Matt's notes below ------

No idea what that description above refers to. Appears to be solely how Betteravia wants their numbers run. That will all be encapsulated in one proc for them. RR confirms these notes are straight from JP, they were not encapsulated in any document.

Hijacking this user story to cover database specific requirements of the Betteravia design laid out by the whole team on 8/11, customer and noncustomer specific parts in tasks.

As a data access layer, I want to hit the db up for performant GDD targeting data for large swaths of the earth, so I can feed that to APIs or whoever needs it from me.",,,
